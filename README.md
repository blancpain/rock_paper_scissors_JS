# Rock Paper Scissors
This is my first program in JS. The classic rock paper scissors game. 

## Main takeaways
Defining functions, generating a random choice, returning values, loops.

##Update
Refined game after learning some new material. Have incorporated event listeners, DOM manipulation, arrays and arrow functions.
